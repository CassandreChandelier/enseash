# enseash


## Question 1


The message of welcome appears without any problem

## Question 2

We have an input for the user, it is executed. After the execution, we print
the prompt enseash % and wait for new command. 
We created a fonction prompt to print each time 'enseash %'

```bash
# define PROMPT "enseash % "
write(1,PROMPT,sizeof(PROMPT));
```
